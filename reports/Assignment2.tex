\section{Introduction}

Support vector machines are an ML model which can be used to classify vectors in a vector space. This method can be applied to the task of classifying documents by representing each document as a vector. In this report, we choose to use a neural model, doc2vec \cite{}, in order to generate vectors. We also [TODO] to show that the vector space produced by the doc2vec model is meaningful, by finding the distances between

\section{Method}

The doc2vec implementation used was gensim \cite{gensim}.

I train the doc2vec model on 100,000 movie reviews from the Stanford Large Movie Review Dataset \cite{maas-EtAl:2011:ACL-HLT2011}. The SVM classifier is then trained on the documents found in the dataset used by pang et al. \cite{pang2002thumbs}. To tune parameters for the doc2vec model, I use a 10\% validation set to evaluate different models, then report accuracies using 10-fold cross validation over the remaining 90\%.
